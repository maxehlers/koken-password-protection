koken-password-protection
=========================

A plugin to workaround the inability of Koken to set passwords for albums. It is made so that you can give passwords to dedicated people so that they may get a list of their own password-protected albums.

# Installation

1. Download :-)
2. Move that directory into /storage/plugins/ of your koken installation
3. Enable the plugin in the koken administration under settings -> plugins
4. Insert the desired jQuery-Selector where the list should appear
5. Edit the file /secure/admin_password.php and insert your desired administration password

# Shortcodes
The plugin comes with two handy shortcodes: Form and List. Due to Koken's limits you have to select an album. But it does not matter which one.

## Form
The form is made so that the users may insert they passwords as well as the administration password to come into the magic

##List
Tell the plugin where the unlocked albums should appear

## Have fun!
